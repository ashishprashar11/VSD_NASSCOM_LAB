	1. Open terminal in UBUNTU
	2. Change working directory to work/tools/openlane_working_directory/openlane
	3. There you will see flow.tcl file by using ls -ltr.
	4. Type "docker" in terminal,
	5. Source flow.tcl in interactive mode by typing ./flow.tcl -interactivep it will shows the above view.
	6. Use "package require openlane 0.9".
	7. You can see already build designs present in designs in directory work/tools/openlane_working_directory/openlane/designs.
	8. Before running the synthesis, need to setup data for design, as only few files are there 
	9.

	10. To setup, use prep -design picorv32a
	11. It will merge files and we donâ€™t need different files it will be shown like below in terminal

	12. A new folder named Runs will come into the directory

12. To view TLEF information, go to directory  work/tools/openlane_working_directory/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/<date>/tmp,  and open merge.lef. You will get layer and wire and cell level information.

	2. Report and result will have information after runs.
	3. Conf.tcl tell info of parameters taken during the run.

	4. In open lane we can make changes in the run. Parameters like core utilization can be changed.
	5. Further run the synthesis by run_synthesis in Openlane prompt. It will run BIOS Synthesis and ABIS run (to get chip module area).

	6. STA has been done, synthesis and ABIS run also get completed, we can see chip module area

	7. Flop ratio = No. of D Flip flop/total no. of cells
	8. So Fxtp= 1613

	And, total no. of cells=14876 

	![image](https://github.com/ashishprashar11/VSD_NASSCOM_LAB/assets/169080904/9b38e088-1495-43eb-aae5-a56a5a9c8a6f)

	Flop count = 1613/14876=0.1084*100= 10.8%
	
13. To see run result for synthesis, go to directory  work/tools/openlane_working_directory/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/<date>/results/synthesis. It contains synthesized netlist
14. You can view synthesized netlist.
15. ![image](https://github.com/ashishprashar11/VSD_NASSCOM_LAB/assets/169080904/1ab84956-bb32-4b9d-833b-7bb33d964b4e)



16. To see timing report go to reports folder, where all reports exists
